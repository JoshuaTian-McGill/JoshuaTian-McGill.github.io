I am a doctoral student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Transportation System under the supervision of Dr. Lijun Sun [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/) in the Department of Civil Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I received my master's degree in Science from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). During my master's studies, I worked on multiplicative optimization problems and various optimization project.

My research interests center around fusing advanced data-driven models with transportation domain knowledge in various transportation problems.

## Research Interests

* Intelligent transporation system
* Optimization models applied to real world problems
* Advanced data-driven models applied to real world problems
* Quantitative models applied to business problems

## Publication

* Fuqiang Liu, Jiawei Wang, Dingyi Zhuang, **Jingbo Tian**, Luis Miranda-Moreno and Lijun Sun (2020) A General Framework Based on Temporally Dynamic Adjacency Matrix for Long-Term Traffic Prediction. **(Working paper)**
